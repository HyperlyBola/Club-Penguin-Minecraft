Appearing on terrain BELOW weirdness 0 or in unfilled("NULL(nothing)") spots in "middle_biomes_variants", here is the "middle_biomes" layout:

[ ARID-ICY, DRY-ICY, NEUTRAL-ICY, WET-ICY, HUMID-ICY ],
[ ARID-COLD, DRY-COLD, NEUTRAL-COLD, WET-COLD, HUMID-COLD ],
[ ARID-NEUTRAL, DRY-NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL-NEUTRAL, WET-NEUTRAL, HUMID-NEUTRAL ],
[ ARID-WARM, DRY-WARM, NEUTRAL-WARM, WET-WARM, HUMID-WARM ],
[ ARID-HOT, DRY-HOT, NEUTRAL-HOT, WET-HOT, HUMID-HOT ]

All keys passed in must be valid in the biome registry!
"minecraft:the_void" is invalid as it represents a value of "NULL(nothing)" internally.
